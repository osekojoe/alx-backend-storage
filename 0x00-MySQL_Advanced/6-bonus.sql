--Write a SQL script that creates a stored procedure AddBonus
-- that adds a new correction for a student.
-- Requirements:
--   Procedure AddBonus is taking 3 inputs (in this order):
--   user_id, a users.id value (you can assume user_id is linked
--     to an existing users)
--   project_name, a new or already exists projects - 
--    if no projects.name found in the table, you should create it
--   score, the score value for the correction
